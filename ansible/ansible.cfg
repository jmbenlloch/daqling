# config file for ansible -- https://ansible.com/
# ===============================================

# nearly all parameters can be overridden in ansible-playbook
# or with command line flags. ansible will read ANSIBLE_CONFIG,
# ansible.cfg in the current working directory, .ansible.cfg in
# the home directory or /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, whichever it
# finds first

[defaults]
# uncomment this to disable SSH key host checking
host_key_checking = False

[privilege_escalation]
#become=True
#become_method=sudo
#become_user=root
#become_ask_pass=False

[ssh_connection]
# ssh arguments to use
# Leaving off ControlPersist will result in poor performance, so use
# paramiko on older platforms rather than removing it, -C controls compression use
#ssh_args = -C -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60s

[persistent_connection]

# Configures the persistent connection timeout value in seconds.  This value is
# how long the persistent connection will remain idle before it is destroyed.  
# If the connection doesn't receive a request before the timeout value 
# expires, the connection is shutdown.  The default value is 30 seconds.
connect_timeout = 30

# Configures the persistent connection retries.  This value configures the
# number of attempts the ansible-connection will make when trying to connect
# to the local domain socket.  The default value is 30.
connect_retries = 30

# Configures the amount of time in seconds to wait between connection attempts 
# to the local unix domain socket.  This value works in conjunction with the
# connect_retries value to define how long to try to connect to the local
# domain socket when setting up a persistent connection.  The default value is
# 1 second.
connect_interval = 1
